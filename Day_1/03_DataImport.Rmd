## Introduction

For the rest of today's sessions, we'll be working with the results from an RNA-Seq dataset.
We're actually going to start with the final results and learn how to import data, manipulate data and visualise data.
Hopefully you'll see the immediate usefulness of what we're showing you.


### R Projects

Before we go any further, we strongly encourage the use of a feature of R Studio called *R Projects*.
These are just a simple & convenient way of organising your code and your data.
For this course our analysis will be relatively simple, but as you go, you may see the importance of keeping everything well organised.

If you go to the **Files** tab in the pane at the bottom right, you should notice that you are in your `Home` directory, as is visible with the ![](images/home.png) symbol at the top of this pane.
We're going to create an R Project in a subdirectory of this called "Day_1".
Please follow these steps **exactly**, and pay particular attention to capital letters and underscores.
We'll need to have these all identical to what we tell you otherwise you're just going to make your own life difficult & you'll end up horribly confused.
Bioinformatics is very much like that.
Near enough is never good enough, and commands need to be typed exactly.
Laziness leads to confusion.

1 - Go to the `File` menu at the top of RStudio & select `New Project...`.
The following dialog will appear:

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='70%', results='asis'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/RProject.png")
```

2 - Select **New Directory**, then **New Project**  
3 - Type the name **Day_1** exactly in the first space in the dialog box that appears  
4 - Click on **Create Project**  

This will have created a new directory called **Day_1** in your home directory, and inside that directory (using the **Files** Tab) you'll see the file `Day_1.Rproj`.
You'll also notice that at the top right of your R Studio session, you'll see a blue cube with Day_1 next to it.
This is where R Studio keeps a list of your current and recent projects.
We strongly encourage using a new R Project for each dataset as it will help you keep your data organised.
They are really nothing more than a wrapper to your directory, but they do make our lives easier.


### Getting today's data

Now we have our directorys organised, we can get today's data.
We'll put it inside a directory called `data` within our R Project, so let's first create this directory.
In your **Files** Tab, click the ![](images/NewFolder.png) icon, and call the directory `data`.

We've already placed the data for today on your VM in a general directory called `data`, so using the **Files** tab, navigate to your Home directory by clicking the ![](images/home.png) icon.
Inside this directory you'll see another one called `data`, so let's enter that and select the checkbox next to the file `DGE_results.tsv`.
Now click the `More` dropbox next to the cog in the **Files** pane, then choose `Move...`, and move this file into your R Project subdirectory data (i.e. in `~/Day_1/data`).
Call a tutor over if you're not sure.

Once we've got that all setup the same for everyone, we'll be off & running!
